# Unexpected Defer Behavior with Panic in Go

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to Go's `defer` statement and the `panic` function.  The example showcases how a `defer` statement will still execute even after a `panic` occurs.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues if not considered carefully.

## Bug Description
The `bug.go` file contains a simple Go program that demonstrates the issue. A `defer` statement is used to print a message after the function completes. However, a `panic` is triggered before the function completes.  Despite the panic, the `defer` statement is still executed, potentially masking the root cause of the error.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.go` file offers a revised approach that illustrates better error handling.  This solution demonstrates using `recover` within a `defer` function to handle the panic gracefully, allowing for more controlled cleanup and logging of errors.
